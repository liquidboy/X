Quickly build rich UI's in your Universal Application .. 

[IMPORTANT : im currently implementing effectlayer across the Input controls SO it is very buggy with lots of redraw/invalidate issues]


Components still being fleshed out...

* LiteTab
* RichButton
* Path
* RichInput
* EffectLayer

* LiteDataGrid - A grid that lets you define several different DataTemplates and then alternate between them with a simple index value.
