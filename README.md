## X.UI framework for Universal Apps

Quickly build rich UI's in your Universal Application .. 

[IMPORTANT : im currently implementing effectlayer across the Input controls SO it is very buggy with lots of redraw/invalidate issues]


Components still being fleshed out...

* LiteTab
* RichButton
* Path
* RichInput
* EffectLayer
* Chrome
* RichTab
* OneBox
* RichScrollViewer
* LiteDataGrid - A grid that lets you define several different DataTemplates and then alternate between them with a simple index value.

And implementing them in a demo app "X.Browser" .. Which is a demonstration browser application, that lets you browse web pages, media content, filesystem...
